1.2.5 update by dizal http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/961798-11-hangable-maps-v11-smp/page__view__findpost__p__14200289

IMPORTANT: This port is incomplete and buggy.

install:
- must server mod add to Minecraft jar, due to ItemWorldMapBaseEdit

bugs:
- placed map contents is cleared on relog
- placed map doesn't update when exploring?
